# Practice Routines — Design

## Overview

Add a practice planning feature to BenchAssist. Coaches browse a curated drill library, filter by category, and get auto-generated practice plans. Fully offline — static drill data ships with the app.

## Data Model

### Age Group on Team

```typescript
export type AgeGroup = 'U6' | 'U8' | 'U10' | 'U12' | 'U14' | 'U16' | 'U18';

// Added to Team interface:
ageGroup: AgeGroup | null;
```

**Migration:** `loadData()` infers from smallest `fieldSize` in team's game configs (5→U8, 7→U10, 9→U12, 11→U14). Defaults to `null` if no configs exist. Team creation dialog adds an age group selector.

### Drill Types (`src/types/drill.ts`)

```typescript
export type DrillId = string;

export type DrillCategory =
  // Technical (all ages, emphasis for younger)
  | 'passing'
  | 'dribbling'
  | 'shooting'
  | 'first-touch'
  | 'goalkeeping'
  // Tactical (U12+)
  | 'attacking'
  | 'defending'
  | 'possession'
  | 'transition'
  | 'set-pieces';

export type DrillPhase = 'warm-up' | 'main' | 'scrimmage' | 'cool-down';

export interface Drill {
  id: DrillId;
  name: string;
  description: string; // 2-3 sentence summary (always visible)
  setup: string; // How to set up the drill (expanded view)
  coachingTips: string[]; // Key things to watch for
  variations?: string[]; // Progressions / modifications
  category: DrillCategory;
  phase: DrillPhase;
  ageGroups: AgeGroup[];
  minPlayers: number;
  durationMinutes: number;
  intensity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  equipment: string[]; // e.g., ['cones', 'pinnies']
}

export interface DrillProgression {
  id: string;
  name: string; // e.g., "Passing: Short to Long Range"
  drillIds: DrillId[]; // ordered sequence
}

export interface TrainingFocusTemplate {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  ageGroups: AgeGroup[];
  slots: {
    phase: DrillPhase;
    preferredCategories: DrillCategory[];
    count: number;
  }[];
}
```

### Favorites

Stored as `favoriteDrillIds: DrillId[]` in AppState (top-level, not per-team). Included in export/import. One new reducer action: `TOGGLE_FAVORITE_DRILL`.

```typescript
export interface AppState {
  teams: Record<TeamId, Team>;
  games: Record<GameId, Game>;
  favoriteDrillIds: DrillId[];
}
```

### Static Data Files

- `src/data/drills.ts` — Array of ~50-100 curated Drill objects
- `src/data/drill-progressions.ts` — DrillProgression[] linking related drills
- `src/data/training-focuses.ts` — TrainingFocusTemplate[] defining practice day structures

Drills are researched best-practice exercises appropriate for each age group. Content generated by agents using web research.

## UX Flow

### Navigation

- Top nav: Add "Practice" between "Teams" and "History"
- Team management page: Add "Practice" shortcut → navigates to `/practice?team={teamId}`

### Route

```
/practice                  — Practice planning page
/practice?team={teamId}    — Same, pre-filtered to team's age group + player count
```

### Page Layout — Unified Browse + Generate

Single page with reactive plan generation. No separate modes or submit buttons.

**Top section (inputs):**

- Age group selector (chip row, pre-selected from team if applicable)
- Player count input (pre-filled from team roster if applicable)
- Category filter chips (multi-select, toggleable). Tactical categories hidden for U6-U8.
- Duration dropdown (30/45/60/75/90 min)
- "Favorites only" toggle

**Bottom section (reactive output):**

When **no categories selected**: browsable drill list grouped by phase. All drills matching age group + player count shown. Each card shows name, category badge, duration, player count, summary, and coaching tip.

When **≥1 category selected**: auto-generated practice plan. Updates live as inputs change. Structure:

1. Warm-up (1 drill, low intensity, from selected or general categories)
2. Main drills (2-3 drills from selected categories, prefer drills from same progression)
3. Scrimmage (1 drill, if enough players)
4. Cool-down (1 drill, low intensity)

Plan targets the selected duration by adjusting drill count and selecting appropriate duration drills.

**Drill cards (always visible):**

- Name + favorite star toggle
- Metadata: category badge, duration, min players
- 2-3 sentence description
- Coaching tip
- "More" expand: setup instructions, variations, equipment

**Plan controls:**

- `[↻]` swap button per drill — replaces with another matching drill
- "Shuffle All" — regenerates entire plan with same constraints
- "Favorites only" — constrains generator to favorited drills only

### Plan Generator Algorithm

Simple, deterministic, runs client-side (no worker needed):

1. Filter drill library by: age group, player count (≥ minPlayers), selected categories
2. For each slot in the plan structure:
   a. Filter to matching phase + preferred categories
   b. Prefer drills from the same DrillProgression (build on each other)
   c. Pick randomly from candidates (seeded for consistent results until shuffle)
3. Adjust number of main drills to fit target duration
4. If not enough drills for a slot, widen category filter or skip

## State Changes

### AppState additions

- `favoriteDrillIds: DrillId[]` at top level
- `ageGroup: AgeGroup | null` on Team

### New reducer actions

- `TOGGLE_FAVORITE_DRILL` — `{ type: 'TOGGLE_FAVORITE_DRILL'; payload: DrillId }`
- `SET_TEAM_AGE_GROUP` — `{ type: 'SET_TEAM_AGE_GROUP'; payload: { teamId: TeamId; ageGroup: AgeGroup | null } }`

### Migration

- `loadData()` handles missing `favoriteDrillIds` (default `[]`)
- `loadData()` handles missing `ageGroup` on teams (infer from field size or default `null`)

## Files to Create/Modify

### New files

- `src/types/drill.ts` — Drill, DrillProgression, TrainingFocusTemplate types
- `src/data/drills.ts` — Static drill library
- `src/data/drill-progressions.ts` — Progression definitions
- `src/data/training-focuses.ts` — Training focus templates
- `src/utils/practiceGenerator.ts` — Plan generation algorithm
- `src/pages/Practice.tsx` — Practice planning page
- `src/utils/practiceGenerator.test.ts` — Generator tests
- `src/pages/Practice.test.tsx` — Page component tests

### Modified files

- `src/types/domain.ts` — Add AgeGroup type, add ageGroup to Team
- `src/context/AppContext.tsx` — Add favoriteDrillIds to state, new reducer actions
- `src/storage/localStorage.ts` — Migration logic for new fields
- `src/App.tsx` — Add /practice route
- `src/components/layout/AppShell.tsx` — Add Practice nav link
- `src/pages/TeamManagement.tsx` — Add age group selector + Practice shortcut
- `src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` — Show age group on team cards (if set)

## Non-goals (V1)

- Persistent saved plans (plans are ephemeral, regenerate as needed)
- Drill diagrams/animations (text descriptions only for V1)
- Custom user-created drills (static library only)
- Multi-sport support (soccer only, architecture supports future sports)
